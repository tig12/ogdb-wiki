  The purpose is to correct and complete the list of <a href="/group/muller-afd1-writers">Italian writers</a>.
  <br>This list, built by Arno Müller using "Chi è?" (1948 edition), needs to be completed:
  <ul class="margin-top0">
      <li>Arno Müller published a <a href="/group/muller-afd1-100writers">list of 100 writers</a> for whom he couldn't find birth times.</li>
      <li>He didn't include female writers.</li>
  </ul>
