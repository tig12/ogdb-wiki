    <br>Birth time provided by Gauquelin can't be confirmed by the current act, which is normal for births in Paris at this date:
    part of the Paris archives were destroyed in 1871 (events known as "La commune de Paris", some acts and their backups were burnt),
    and acts prior to 1860 were lost.
    <br>So we don't know how Gauquelin was able to find the birth hour.
    <br>If someone knows, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.
